    <ul>
        <li>Added "organisation" in the Proposal Partners</li>

        <li>Uses consistent format of dates and specifies "Swiss time"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version deployed on 29/11/2019</h2>

    We have implemented some of these things after talking with Basil, Dani√®le and Laurence. Please let us know if it's
    not what you expected.
    <ul>
        <li>New organisation list available</li>
        <li>Now an applicant can create organisation names (an organisation can have multiple names). This allows
            applicants to enter organisations that are not in the system, and it will also allow us to create reports
            (the management part to link organisation names and organisations is not done yet, it will be done after
            the release for the Polar Access Fund).
        </li>
        <li>Improved texts after the application Submission or Save Draft</li>
        <li>For the budget: thousands separator as ' is accepted (and displayed)</li>
        <li>"<strong>*</strong>" are not displayed in the Funding organisations table column names (it was confusing
            because
            it's not a mandatory field)
        </li>
        <li>Better error handling for files (if the object storage is not available it saves the application and shows a
            message to the user regarding the file)
        <li>Added overarching project for calls such as Polar Access Fund</li>
        <li>High-altitude typo corrected</li>
        <li>When creating a call, data policy changed to privacy policy</li>

        <li>Known bug: if an applicant attaches a file into a proposal and the proposal cannot be validated (e.g. wrong
            dates, missing fields, etc): the applicant might need to attach the file again
        </li>
        <li>Known bug: (thanks Basil!) it's not possible to create a call using Microsoft Edge
        </li>
        <li>Known important missing feature: add organisation to the proposal partners</li>
    </ul>
